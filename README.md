# Neural Project
Simple machine learning iterations and calculations.

## Project Summary
A neural project which fetches a given dataset of examples and applies learning cycles. After completing the given number of cycles it will predict the type of the given object.

In the begging the project will only read simple images, but it is easily scalable.

## Warning
Project under construction.

## Installation Notes
Not at a functional state yet. Please wait for the first stable version.

## Contribution
Feel free to use the code for your own projects. After first stable release I'd be glad to get a feedback with possible errors or mistakes.
